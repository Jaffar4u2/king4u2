Signature Registers for Small-Delay Defect Detection
 delay measurement technique
using signature analysis, and a scan design for the proposed delay
measurement technique to detect small-delay defects. The proposed measurement technique measures the delay of the explicitly
sensitized paths with the resolution of the on-chip variable clock
generator. The proposed scan design realizes complete on-chip
delay measurement in short measurement time using the proposed
delay measurement technique and extra latches for storing the test
vectors. The evaluation with Rohm 0.18- m process shows that
the measurement time is 67.8% reduced compared with that of
the delay measurement with standard scan design on average. The
area overhead is 23.4% larger than that of the delay measurement
architecture using standard scan design, and the difference of the
area overhead between enhanced scan design and the proposed
method is 7.4% on average. The data volume is 2.2 times of that of
test set for normal testing on average
